For all website designs, make them beautiful, unique, and production-ready (not cookie-cutter). Use React + JSX with Tailwind CSS, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not add extra UI packages unless I request them or they are absolutely necessary. Use Lucide React for logos/icons. Use Unsplash stock photos with valid https://images.unsplash.com/... URLs directly in <img> tags (do not download).

Designs must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile) and meet accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, alt text, color contrast). Include smooth hover/focus states, subtle transitions, and tasteful animations (e.g., Framer Motion). Code should be clean, modular, and reusable with flexible props. Optimize performance with lazy-loaded images and efficient hook usage.

Favor grid-based layouts, rounded corners (2xl), soft shadows, and varied typography (xl for headings, base for body). Default building blocks should include polished Cards, Navbars, Hero sections, CTAs, Forms, and Footers. Pages must feel professional, visually engaging, and ready for production deployment.
